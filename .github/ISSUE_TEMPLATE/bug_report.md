!!IMPORTANT!!

READ BEFORE OPENING AN ISSUE:

- If you don't provide enough information in your issue for me to reproduce (such as version and any custom configuration), I will close it. I can't keep wasting my time investigating issues which no longer exist.
- Check the Troubleshooting Guide! https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/troubleshooting Some solutions to common problems are detailed there. In general, first search the docs.


Again, HAVE YOU CHECKED THE DOCS? Use the search bar on the docs page before rushing to open an issue.
